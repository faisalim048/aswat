 A PHP/AngularJs Application for test purpose
 The	purpose of this application is to be an evaluation or an assessment by	**ASWAT-TELECOM** .
     Prepare a system mimicking a shopping cart which has a backend made in nodeJS/PHP/Python and fronted using AngularJS
    The backend should be able to add/edit/delete products and product categories
    Frontend should be able to list the product and product categories and add items to the cart and save it for later checkout (using JS local storage)
    Database can be of your choice (mysql/mongodb/flat-file)
Additional implementation include users management, register/sign-in to add to cart but allowing users to view products without register/sign-in .
